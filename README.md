#Bootstrap Exercise

In this project, we have been tasked with creating a website called [Whiskey Drop](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/bootstrap/).

It's a whiskey subscription service. Yum!

The main task of this project is to illustrate the use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), 
and how Bootstrap can help in the creation of Mobile-up websites.
In other words, Bootstrap is a framework that allows you to create a website using its open-source "ingredients",
and that the ideal way of creating a website is to start from the smallest screens and work up from there;
this allows you to put your wireframe to best use, as it forces you to concentrate on the most impertinent things.

Bootstrap features:

Table: .thead-light

Grid system: .col-12; .col-md-6 & .d-md-none; .col-lg-4 & .d-lg-block

    .col-12 = "Full-size" rows for mobile devices

    .col-md-6 & .d-md-none = "Half-size" rows & hidden row for medium devices

    .col-lg-4 & .d-lg-block = "Third-size" rows & redisplay hidden row for large devices
