#Bootstrap Exercise

In this project, we have been tasked with creating a website called [Whiskey Drop](http://to-go=here).

It's a whiskey subscription service. Yum!

The main task of this project is to illustrate the use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), 
and how Bootstrap can help in the creation of Mobile-up websites.
In other words, Bootstrap is a framework that allows you to create a website using its open-source "ingredients",
and that the ideal way of creating a website is to start from the smallest screens and work up from there;
this allows you to put your wireframe to best use, as it forces you to concentrate on the most impertinent things.
